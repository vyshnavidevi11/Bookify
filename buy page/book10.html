      <h3>About the Author</h3>
      <p>.K. Rowling is best-known as the author of the seven Harry Potter books, which were published between 1997 and 2007.
         The enduringly popular adventures of Harry, Ron and Hermione have gone on to sell over 600 million copies worldwide, 
         be translated into 85 languages and made into eight blockbuster films.
        Alongside the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling also wrote three short companion volumes for charity: Quidditch Through the Ages and Fantastic Beasts
         and Where to Find Them, in aid of Comic Relief, and The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in aid of her international children’s charity, Lumos.
         The companion books and original series are all available as audiobooks.
        In 2016, J.K. Rowling collaborated with playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany to continue Harry’s story in a stage play,
         Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which opened in London, and is now playing in multiple locations around the world.
          The script book was published to mark the plays opening in 2016 and instantly topped the bestseller lists.
        In the same year, she made her debut as a screenwriter with the film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
         Inspired by the original companion volume, it was the first in a series of new adventures featuring wizarding world magizoologist Newt Scamander.
          The second, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,
         was released in 2018 and the third, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore was released in 2022.</p>

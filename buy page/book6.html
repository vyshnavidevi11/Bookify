            <h2>about this item: </h2>
            <p>“The book you hold in your hands is the distillate of a quarter century’s teaching.
                 It is my attempt to answer, ‘What next?’ for students who are embarking on their ‘second act.’” —Julia Cameron Julia Cameron has inspired millions with her
                  bestseller on creativity, The Artist’s Way. In It’s Never Too Late To Begin Again, she turns her eye to a segment of the population that,
                   ironically, while they have more time to be creative, are often reluctant or intimidated by the creative process. Cameron shows readers that retirement can,
                    in fact, be the most rich, fulfilling, and creative time of their lives.
                 When someone retires, the newfound freedom can be quite exciting, but also daunting.
